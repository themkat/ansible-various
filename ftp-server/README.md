# Simple FTP server setup
Made to be used for a simple Raspberry Pi file server that needed to access external drives (USB, CD ROMS etc.). Why? It makes it easy to transfer files to multiple computers (Mac, Amiga, GPD Win 2 etc.) at the same time without putting the CDs into each system (spoiler: two of them don't have CD drives).


Vagrant setup for prototyping and testing locally is included.
